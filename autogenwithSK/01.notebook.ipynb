      "{\"kb\": \"History of machine learning\", \"content\": \"The history of machine learning and artificial intelligence is marked by significant discoveries and periods of progress and stagnation. Notable discoveries include Bayes Theorem (1763, 1812), Least Square Theory (1805), Markov Chains (1913), Perceptron (1957), Nearest Neighbor (1967), Backpropagation (1970), and Recurrent Neural Networks (1982). The concept of a 'machine that can think' was introduced by Alan Turing in 1950. The Dartmouth Summer Research Project in 1956 coined the term 'artificial intelligence'. The period from 1956 to 1974 is known as 'The golden years' of AI. The 'AI Winter' from 1974 to 1980 was a period of reduced funding and confidence in AI. The 1980s saw the rise of 'expert systems'. The 'AI Chill' from 1987 to 1993 was marked by the rise of personal computers. From 1993 to 2011, the field matured with the increase in data and compute power.
