It can even understand the intent behind your comments, making it a powerful tool for code generation. However, it's important to note that while GitHub Copilot can generate code suggestions, it's not a replacement for a human coder.

Additionally, while Copilot can offer multiple suggestions, it's up to the developer to choose the most appropriate one. This requires a good understanding of the code base and the problem at hand.
