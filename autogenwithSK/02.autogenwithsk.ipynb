It employs algorithms to discover hidden patterns in data, which then enable the machines to learn, think, and make decisions like a human being. However, ML does not encompass deep learning, neural networks, and other facets of AI. Its use has been constantly increasing due to its various real-world applications like predicting diseases, weather events, and detecting fake news among others. The historical journey of ML and AI is interesting and has been marked by significant discoveries, progress, and periods of stagnation. Key milestones include the development of insights like Bayes Theorem, Least Square Theory, Markov Chains, Perceptron, Nearest Neighbor, Backpropagation, and Recurrent Neural Networks. The concept of a 'thinking machine' was first introduced by Alan Turing in 1950 and the term 'AI' was first used in 1956 during the Dartmouth Summer Research Project. The period from 1974 to 1980, known as the 'AI Winter', was a period of reduced funding and interest in AI. However, the field matured from 1993 to 2011 due to increased data and computing power, and today, AI and ML have become integral parts of our daily lives. \\n\\n## What is Machine Learning?\\nML is a way of achieving AI and it's about creating systems that can learn from data. Like a human, the more data the system has, the more it can adapt and learn. It's a method of data analysis that automates analytical model building, using algorithms that iteratively learn from data. ML allows computers to find hidden insights without being explicitly programmed where to look.\\n\\n## AI vs ML\\nAI and ML are often used interchangeably, but they are not the same. AI is a broad umbrella under which ML fits. AI is the quest for making machines intelligent, for lack of a better word, while ML is one of the methods to achieve that intelligence. In other words, ML is a type of AI that allows a system to learn from experience.\\n\\n## History of Machine Learning\\nMachine Learning has seen numerous progressions since its inception. With every achievement, ML has enabled us to imagine a world where machines can think and learn like human beings, thus broadening our perspective on technology and its capabilities. Remember that the quest for AI has been a rollercoaster ride with rapid adoption of technology in the shifts. So, when you think about ML, consider its historical transformations that have brought us here today. The transformation from mere concepts of 'thinking machines' to the application of layered neural networks, the journey has been game-changing.\\n\\nIn later sections of this blog, we dive into the specifics of different ML techniques, their applications, benefits, and how they are shaping our tomorrow. So stay tuned!\"\n",

However, ML does not include deep learning, neural networks, and other aspects of AI. Its usage has been on the rise due to its various real-world applications such as predicting diseases, weather events, and detecting fake news. The history of ML and AI is fascinating, marked by significant discoveries, progress, and periods of stagnation.\\n\\nThe concept of a 'thinking machine' was first introduced by Alan Turing in 1950, and the term 'AI' was first used in 1956 during the Dartmouth Summer Research Project. The period from 1974 to 1980, known as the 'AI Winter', was a time of reduced funding and interest in AI. However, the field matured from 1993 to 2011 due to increased data and computing power. Today, AI and ML have become integral parts of our daily lives.\\n\\n## **Defining Machine Learning**\\n\\nMachine Learning is a method of achieving Artificial Intelligence. It's about creating systems that can learn from data. The more data the system has, the more it can adapt and learn. It's a method of data analysis that automates analytical model building, using algorithms that iteratively learn from data. Machine Learning allows computers to find hidden insights without being explicitly programmed where to look.\\n\\n## **Distinguishing AI and ML**\\n\\nArtificial Intelligence and Machine Learning are often used interchangeably, but they are not the same. AI is a broad umbrella under which ML fits. AI is the quest for making machines intelligent, while ML is one of the methods to achieve that intelligence. In other words, Machine Learning is a type of Artificial Intelligence that allows a system to learn from experience.\\n\\n## **Tracing the History of Machine Learning**\\n\\nMachine Learning has seen numerous advancements since its inception. With every achievement, Machine Learning has enabled us to envision a world where machines can think and learn like human beings, thus broadening our perspective on technology and its capabilities.

The transformation from mere concepts of 'thinking machines' to the application of layered neural networks, the journey has been game-changing.\\n\\nIn the following sections of this blog, we delve into the specifics of different Machine Learning techniques, their applications, benefits, and how they are shaping our future.
