Intro

0:08
hello and welcome to this course on
0:11
classical machine learning for beginners
0:13
whether you're completely new to the
0:15
topic or an experienced ml practitioner
0:17
looking to brush up on an area we're
0:19
happy to have you join us this course is

Introducing ML for Beginners

0:22
based on the free open source 26 lesson
0:25
ml for beginners curriculum from
0:27
Microsoft which can be found at AKA dot
0:30
Ms slash ml-beginners machine learning
0:34
is one of the most popular Technologies
0:36
these days I'm sure you've heard this
0:38
term if you have any sort of familiarity
0:41
with technology no matter what domain
0:42
you work in however the mechanics of
0:45
machine learning are a mystery to most
0:47
people and the subject can sometimes
0:49
feel overwhelming in this course you'll
0:51
start right from the beginning and
0:53
you'll learn about it step by step to
0:56
practical Hands-On coding examples let's

The difference between AI and ML

0:58
start by talking about the difference
1:00
between artificial intelligence and
1:03
machine learning AI is a science of
1:05
getting machines to accomplish tasks
1:07
that typically require human level
1:09
intelligence many different techniques
1:12
have been proposed for AI but the most
1:14
successful and popular approach these
1:16
days is machine learning
1:19
unlike other AI techniques ml uses
1:22
specialized algorithms to make decisions
1:24
by learning from data so machine
1:28
learning is really a subset of
1:30
artificial intelligence
1:32
you've also probably heard of deep
1:33
learning which is a subset of machine
1:35
learning that relies on neural networks
1:38
to learn from data in this course we're

What you'll learn in this course

1:40
going to cover what we call classical
1:42
machine learning you'll learn some Core
1:45
Concepts of ml a bit of History
1:48
statistical techniques like regression
1:50
classification clustering and more
1:54
the concepts you'll learn here will
1:55
serve you well as you progress to more
1:57

Advanced Techniques

What you won't learn in this course
1:59
keep in mind that this course won't
2:00
cover data science deep learning neural
2:03
networks and AI techniques other than ml
2:06
Microsoft offers two additional courses
2:09
for you to learn more about these areas
2:10
data science for beginners available at
2:13
AKA dot Ms slash data science beginners
2:16
and AI for beginners available at aka.ms
2:20
Ai and beginners machine learning is a

Why study Machine Learning

2:23
Hot Topic because it's solving complex
2:25
real-world problems in so many areas
2:28
Finance earth science space exploration
2:31
cognitive science and many more Fields
2:33
have adopted machine learning to solve
2:35
problems specific to their domains for
2:39
example you can use machine learning to
2:41
predict the likelihood of disease from a
2:43
patient's medical history
2:45
to anticipate weather events to
2:48
understand the sentiment of a text and
2:50
to detect fake news and stop the spread
2:52
of propaganda applications of machine
2:54
learning are almost everywhere and are
2:57
as ubiquitous as the data that is
2:59
Flowing from our devices and systems
3:01
because of how useful it is
3:03
understanding the basics of machine
3:04
learning is going to help you no matter
3:06
what domain you're coming from in the
3:09
next video in the series I'll give an
3:10
overview of the history of ml I'll see
3:13
you there
