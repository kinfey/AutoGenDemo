Intro

0:08
the process of building machine learning
0:10
models is very different from any other
0:13
development workflow in this video
0:15
you'll learn about that process more
0:18
specifically you learn about deciding
0:20
whether AI is the right approach for
0:22
your problem collecting and preparing
0:24
your data
0:25
training your model evaluating your
0:28
model tuning the hyper parameters and
0:30
testing the trained model in the real
0:32
world

Decide if AI is the right approach

0:34
traditional software is well suited to
0:36
solve problems where the solution can be
0:39
described as a formal set of rules in
0:42
contrast AI shines in solving problems
0:44
where the solution can be extracted from
0:46
data many of the problems we encountered
0:49
in our daily life can be efficiently
0:51
solved with traditional programming if
0:53
an engineer can break up the solution of
0:55
a problem and Define it using precise
0:57
rules then traditional programming is a
0:59
great tool to use but many of the
1:01
problems we encounter in our day-to-day
1:03
aren't quite as easy to Define as a set
1:05
of rules thankfully for many of those
1:08
problems we have access to plenty of
1:10
real life data containing useful
1:12
information which means that AI can help
1:14
us find a solution one good example is
1:17
translating from one language to another
1:19
writing a set of rules that full encodes
1:22
all the parallels between two languages
1:24
is not easy but there are many examples
1:26
of translation online so AI has been
1:29
able to do a much better job of
1:30
translation than previous attempts so
1:33
our first step when we're starting a new
1:35
project should be to analyze the problem
1:37
and determine which technique is best to
1:39
solve it if you're able to obtain plenty
1:41
of data that contains useful information
1:43
about your solution then AI is a
1:46
promising approach once you decided that

Collect and prepare data

1:48
AI is the right method for you you need
1:50
to collect and prepare your data for
1:52
example you may need to normalize it or
1:54
convert it to a different form or remove
1:56
rows that are missing certain Fields
1:58
once your data is clean you need to
2:00
decide about which aspects of your data
2:03
or features you're going to use as input
2:05
to your prediction and which feature you
2:07
want to predict for example if you have
2:10
medical data you may decide to use
2:12
features that describe the patient's
2:14
medical history as input and a chance of
2:16
a particular disease as the output
2:18
feature you want to predict
2:21
and finally you need to split your data
2:23
into training and test sets a usual
2:25
split is 80 for your training data and
2:29
20 for test

Train your model

2:31
next you need to choose a machine
2:33
learning algorithm which you'll learn a
2:35
lot about in the coming videos if you're
2:37
undecided between a few good algorithms
2:39
you may want to try them all and see
2:41
which one performs best
2:43
then you need to train your model using
2:45
the training set you collected earlier
2:47
and the algorithm you chose training a
2:50
model may take a while especially if the
2:52
model is large

Evaluate your model

2:53
once the model is trained you can test
2:55
it using the test data set that you
2:57
split earlier it's important that you
3:00
test the algorithm with data that it
3:01
hasn't seen during training to ensure
3:04
that it generalizes well to new
3:06
scenarios

Tune the hyperparameters

3:07
some algorithms contain hyper parameters
3:10
which are settings that control key
3:11
aspects of their inner workings choosing
3:14
good hyper parameters is important
3:16
because they can make a big difference
3:17
in your results if you want to be
3:19
systematic about your hyper parameter
3:21
search you can write code that tries
3:23
lots of different combinations and helps
3:26
you discover the best values for your
3:27
data once you get good test results it's
Test the model in the real world
3:30
time to see how well your model performs
3:32
within the context of its intended use
3:34
for example this could involve
3:36
collecting live data from a sensor and
3:38
using it to make predictions or
3:40
deploying a model to a few users of your
3:42
application if it all looks good then
3:45
you're ready to release it to production
3:46
and enjoy its benefits
3:49
make sure you watch the next video where
3:51
we'll start getting Hands-On with
3:53
machine learning by configuring all the
3:55
tools we'll use in the rest of the
3:57
series I'll see you there
