Intro

0:08
in this video I want to give you a bit
0:11
of Background by walking through the
0:13
major milestones in the history of
0:14
machine learning and artificial
0:16
intelligence
0:17
the modern world of artificial

Alan Turing and the Turing test

0:19
intelligence really begun in 1950s
0:21
though it's based on mathematical and
0:24
statistical developments over many
0:26
centuries Alan Turing is credited with
0:28
helping to lay the foundation for the
0:30
concept of a machine they can think
0:33
in his quest to Define machine
0:35
intelligence he achieved a crucial
0:37
Milestone by creating the Turing test in
0:40
1950. in this test an interrogator
0:43
questions both a human and a computer
0:45
and tries to determine which one is
0:47
which
0:48
if the interrogator cannot tell the
0:50
difference then the computer can be
0:52
considered intelligent in 1956 the term

The Dartmouth Summer Research Project on AI

0:55
artificial intelligence was coined with
0:57
a small group of scientists gathered at
1:00
Dartmouth College in the U.S for an
1:02
event called the summer research project
1:04
on artificial intelligence
1:06
this conference was the birth of the
1:09
field of research we know as AI the
1:11
years from 1956 to 1974 are known as The

The golden years of AI

1:15
Golden Ears of AI optimism ran high in
1:19
the hope that AI could solve many
1:21
problems in 1967 Marvin Minsky the
1:24
co-founder of the mitai lab stated
1:27
confidently and incorrectly that within
1:30
a generation the problem of creating
1:32
artificial intelligence will
1:34
substantially be solved
1:36
natural language processing research
1:39
flourished search was refined and made
1:41
more powerful and the concept of micro
1:44
worlds was created where simple tasks
1:46
were completed using plain language
1:48
instructions
1:50
research was well funded by government
1:51
agencies advances were made in
1:54
computation and algorithms and
1:56
prototypes of intelligent machines were
1:58
built
1:59
some of these machines include shaky the
2:01
robot who could maneuver and decide how
2:04
to perform tasks intelligently Eliza and
2:07
gnarly charabot that could converse with
2:10
people and act as a primitive therapist
2:12
Blocksworld an example of a micro world
2:15
where blogs get could be stacked and
2:17
sorted and decision-making experiments
2:19
could be tested by the mid-1970s it had

The AI winter

2:22
become apparent that the complexity of
2:24
making intelligent machines had been
2:26
understated and that its promise had
2:28
been overblown compute power was too
2:31
limited there was a lack of data to
2:33
train and test AIS and there were
2:35
questions around the ethics of
2:37
introducing AI systems like the
2:39
therapist Eliza into society
2:42
funding dried up and confidence in the
2:44
field slowed marking the beginning of
2:46
what is called an AI winter in the 1980s
2:49
as computers became more powerful expert

Resurgence and fall of AI for expert systems

2:52
systems became more successful there was
2:55
a Resurgence in optimism about AI as
2:58
businesses found practical applications
3:00
of these rule-based inference systems by
3:03
the late 80s it was becoming apparent
3:05
that expert systems had become too
3:07
specialized and were unlikely to achieve
3:10
machine intelligence the rise of
3:12
personal computers also competed with
3:15
these large specialized centralized
3:16
systems this led to another chill in the
3:19
AI field things began to change in the
3:22
mid-1990s as compute and storage
3:24
capabilities grew exponentially making
3:27
it possible to process much larger data

Growth in AI driven by more data and more powerful hardware

3:30
sets than ever before
3:32
the rise of the internet and the
3:34
popularity of smartphones both
3:36
contributed to increasing amounts of
3:38
data a new experiments in machine
3:39
learning became possible
3:42
throughout the 2000s significant
3:44
advancements were made in computer
3:45
vision and natural language processing
3:47
by training machine learning models on
3:50

Big Data

3:52
in the past decade compute power and the
3:55
size of data sets have continued to grow
3:57
and machine learning has become capable
4:00
of solving even more problems as a
4:02
result today machine learning touches
4:04
almost every part of our Lives sometimes
4:07
we're well aware of it like when we
4:09
interact with chat TPT in the browser or
4:12
see a self-driving car go by
4:14
but most of the time it's seamlessly
4:16
woven into familiar experiences of our
4:19
everyday life such as when we're
4:21
approved for a new loan or get a catalog
4:23
at home

Increased awareness of ethical and responsible AI

4:25
this era has also been marked by an
4:27
increased awareness of potential ethical
4:29
issues in machine learning and by
4:31
significant research in the field of
4:33
responsible AI
4:34
we want the benefits of AI but we also
4:37
want AI that is responsible and doesn't
4:39
amplify human bias
4:42
in the next video we will introduce
4:44
techniques for building using and
4:46
maintaining machine learning models I'll
4:48
see you there
